# CodeSample
This repository contains code samples of different tasks and questions I have solved. It should be noted that the code samples in the files have been created using the Java and Dart programming languages. Dart is used to create functional apps, and I have just started learning Dart, so I am in the learning stage.
Currently, there are two branches Sparsh-patch-1 and Sparsh-patch-2. Both branches contain code samples for Java and Dart.
